# add-lib demo-app

An app that can be contacted via a REPL and have a library added.

See Alex Miller's post on [add-lib](http://insideclojure.org/2018/05/04/add-lib/)

## Pre-requisites for add-lib

1. Use deps.edn
2. Have a dependency on org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha
3. Be started with a clojure.lang.DynamicClassLoader

## Optional

For editor interop this project relies on [lein-tools-deps](https://github.com/RickMoynihan/lein-tools-deps)

## Run the app 

```bash
$ clj -m reptile-demo-app.core 9075
```

This project will try to start a socket server on a port given on the command line or grab an unused port if none are 
specified. 

The project will keep running until you kill it / press Ctrl-C

## Connect REPL
You can now connect up your REPL

Here are some samples you can run to prove out the functions

```clojure 
(use 'clojure.tools.deps.alpha.repl)
(add-lib 'org.clojure/core.logic
 {:git/url "https://github.com/clojure/core.logic" 
  :sha "10ee95eb2bed70af5bc29ea3bd78b380f054a8b4"})

(use 'clojure.core.logic)
(run* [q] (== q true))
```

```clojure 
(use 'clojure.tools.deps.alpha.repl)
(add-lib 'crypto-password {:mvn/version "0.2.0"})

(require '[crypto.password.bcrypt :as password])
(def encrypted (password/encrypt "foobar"))
(password/check "foobar" encrypted) 
```

## GOTCHAs when adding libs

Please note that `tools.deps` only understands git SHAs for projects that have a valid Manifest - pom.xml or deps.edn

You will see an error like `Manifest type not detected when finding deps for ...` when you attempt to add a 
library where these conditions are not satisfied.
